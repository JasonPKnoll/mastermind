Project: *Master Mind*

Group Member Names: *Antonio King, Jason Knoll*

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
*Update: Keep awareness of project time, progress, and concept learning. Allot time for individualize learning and processing.*

How would you describe your preferred working style?
*I like to schedule the project work time, set goals/timeline in advance, and check-in daily. I also like talking everything out.*

*I had a lot of success working with others during mod 0. I especially like the driver, and navigator roles. It can help solidify certain ideas that I am working to grasp.*
*Daily Check-ins*
*Talk things out*
*Take time to process new lessons*
What strengths do you bring to a team?
*I'm an excellent communicator, highly organized and adaptable. I also know how to take care of myself and tips to maximize focus/retention/productivity.*
*Collaboration is a huge key to success. I am great at active listening and work to ensure that everyone gets an opportunity to be included in the experience.*
How do you prefer to handle disagreements that come up? Trust me, they will come up!
*I will be very direct in a calm, curious and constructive manner. I want the conflict to get resolved so we can keep moving forward. I rarely get frustrated or angry in these types of situations. Best to state the issue, describe how you feel and explain what can be done to make the situation better.*
*I have found that disagreements are best resolved with one on one conversations and compromise if need be. Everyone has there own method for communicating conflict. I believe it is best to adapt to others needs and communicate in a way that serves them best. Example: some prefer writing out thoughts, some prefer verbal communication, and others prefer a mixture of the two. I believe any of them can work well, and multiple should be tried if more is being miscommunicated through one of the other methods. I like all ways of communication. The biggest thing for me is that things are being communicated in general regardless of the methods.*
How do you communicate best? What tools do you need to communicate well with your teammates?
*Talking via phone/zoom is ideal because they are less time consuming and easier to gauge whether everyone is on the same page. However, it's also necessary to have a paper trail to reference in case you want to reflect/understand thought processes/track progress.*
*Utilizing instant messenger tools such as Slack is the best way to stay in communication with teammates. I am happy to adapt to others constrants, and communicate in a way that may work better for them.*
How do you prefer to make decisions as a team?
*Everyone in the team should have input into each decision. Timing will likely be an influencing factor, however, that shouldn't be an excuse to take shortcuts. I typically always want to go the long way which is more challenging and furthers understanding.*
*Collectively. It is best that most if not everyone's on board with the decisions being made. Best to bounce ideas off each other before coming to a solid conclusion as well. It is also good to be flexible as new information and ideas come up, but to ensure that every group member stays in the loop consistently.*
What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
*Processing time, feedback, interaction, pomodoro, sleep, sunlight, fresh air, coffee, snacks, exercise.*
*Efficient breaks via the pomodoro technique are preferred.*
What scheduling constraints do you have? What are your preferred work times outside of normal school hours?
*Evenings and weekends. My mind is never ready to focus before 8am MST. I will reliably be available after 7:30 every night with more flexibility on Mondays, Tuesdays and every other Fri/Sat/Sun (days I don't have my kids). My cut off point is 11pm MST.*
*Mornings are typically pretty busy. I tend to cram a lot into them to ensure that I am starting my day right. Breakfast, showers, pre reading materials, etc. Other than that I am very flexible as I have no life but Turing.*
How do you prefer to receive feedback? How do you prefer to give feedback?
*I would prefer feedback be written at first, then followed up with conversation. Timing between the two is irrelevant. Having something reference allows me to fully understand the issue, how to adapt and verify progress. I've been told I accept feedback incredibly well, so don't be afraid to offer it. I thrive on improvement and adaptability. I would prefer to give feedback in the same manner.*
*Getting and giving feedback one on one is my preferred method in group settings*
How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into blockers on the project?
*If there is ever a problem, it needs to be addressed right away so we can work together to fix it.*
*If an entire group is being affected by blockers then the group should collectively work on resolving that issue in as tactful of a way as possible.*
What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can you come up with to approach those moments?
*My kids are my main concern, but I don't have them with me every day. I plan to hire a baby sitter or 2 to have on standby in case I need more time to work on projects.*
*Life can be unpredictable at times. The best thing to do is to maintain open communication with team members so they will know if you may be less available than usual. Most people are understanding.*
Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
*I will recommend group breaks for time to connect as well coming up with a system to program together. I also use an app called Marco Polo which is great for staying connected with friends and family. Sometimes you just need something to talk to for a few minutes and then get back to work. This allows you to leave short video messages. It's really fun actually.*
*Little gestures go far. Just simply checking in with someones day or week can help make a difference.*

Pomodoro Break Schedule: *25 minutes on, and 4 minutes off*
